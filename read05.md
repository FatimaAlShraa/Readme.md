# COMPARISON , LOGIC OPERATORS AND LOOPS


## Comparision operator 

it's to evaluate a station by comparing one value in script to what you expect it might be
the result it will be T or F .

== equal to value only 

=== equal to value and data type

!= is not equal value only 

!== is not equal value and data type


## Logical operator 

I can understand when we use comparison op. we have single value but in logical operator
we can compare the result of more than one comparison operator 

&  and (sympol of logical op.) if one retuns fulse the expression fulse 

|| or  if one retuns true the expression true 

! not  one retun 


## Loop

loop check a condetion if the condition is true a code will run until the condition retuns fulse
if condition fulse there are three common type of loop 

For it's to run code in specifc number of time 

While if we dont know how many times code will be true

Do While  it's similar to wile loop but it's always run inside {} even the condition is fulse


in FOR loop use counter as condition we can use 3 statements :

* initialzation its only creat firs loop 

+ condition loop continue until specified number 

+ update ++ every time loop add one to counter in {}
