#  FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING



Q1: Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Q2: If it gives the same parameters, the function is pure if it returns the same result, without causing any visible side effects.

Q3:they are immediately testable. They will always produce the same result if you pass in the same arguments.

Q4:Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

Q5:It is term described for pure functions + immutable data.

## Modules and require ( )

Q1:Module in Node. js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which can be reused throughout the Node. js application

Q2:  using require and passing to it the path of the file we want

Q3: export it from the module file and then require it at our file

Q9:we have to export it using the add() function in the .js file
