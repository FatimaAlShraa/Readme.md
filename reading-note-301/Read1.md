# Component-Based Architecture

1-A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined
 functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface or we can say 
component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality 


2-Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. 

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

# Props

1-React is a component-based library 

2-
+ Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)

+ Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props

+ Finally, render the Props Data

3- props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)
