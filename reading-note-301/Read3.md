# Lists and Keys

first we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values.
 can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces { } and we can loop
around array by map and make list by < li >

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
should keep the key on the < ListItem / > elements in the array and must only be unique 


## Spread Operator

 useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into 
a function’s arguments and  was added to JavaScript in ES6 (ES2015), just like the rest parameters.

+ used for :

+ we can trying to find the largest number in an array with Math.max()

+ pass an array to a JavaScript function expecting separate arguments does not work

*what else can do?*

+ Copying an array
+ Concatenating or combining arrays
+ Using Math functions
+ Using an array as arguments
+ Adding an item to a list
+ Adding to state in React
+ Combining objects
+ Converting NodeList to an array

*example*
