to talk about html an to learn many things about it I will strat in :

## Structure of HTML

HTML  describes the structure of a Web page HTML consists of elements that tell the browser how to display the content HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link"
and this element made up of two tags:

+ open tag for example < head > 


+ close tag <\ head >

in html elements there is a code wich contain the information of webpage it is consist of:

+ head ( where we put the information about page)

+ body ( contain what we want to add in this page( header,main,footer))


## *Extra Markup*

Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML until they creat html5
so we use DOCTYPE to tell the computer we use HTML5 , so we can use several elemants in HTML and I will put some example of those elements:


+ ***<!-- comment goes here -->*** we use it to add comment in HTML and its not visible in webpage

+ **<p id="one">** id we use it to  identify that element from other elements on the page it's like id for any person

+ **< p class="important"> it's like id but in class we use it to several elements** 

+ < h1>, < p>, < ul>, and < li>  we use it to block element

+ **<span>** we use it to inline element and we use it with <div> to  group 
block-level and inline elements together.


## HTML5 Layout

It's talk about hoe we can  arrangement of visual elements on a page , for alog time they use <div> to layout 
but now there a several element to do it.

*we can now dived up th part of page with new element so what are these element ?*
**okey we can start with header and footer**
***< header> and < footer>  appears at the top or bottom of every page on the 
site***

The next element is ***< nav> tag is used to declaring the navigational section in HTML documents***

< nav>
  < a href="/html/">HTML</a> 
 
< /nav>


Then we use < article> ...which is  self-contained composition in a document or page

for example :
 < article>
< h2>home page< /h2>
< /article>

And we can use other element such as < section> , < figure> and <div> 



## Process & Design

when we creat webpage we should follow some steps before we craet it and after
and we must think about this page why we want to creat it and who are the people thay will open this site
after that we made smothing we call it Sit map (diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site)
and WireFrame


when we design any website we should care about 3 things :

+ visual hierarchy ( it's gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for and using graphic design elements like color, size,
 it's very imoprtant becouse it's what the user watch)

+ grouping and Similarity ( organize visual elements into groups)





# JavaScript
 
 we use JavaScript in browsers to make websites more interactive by add element ,accessing and modifiying contant
 and we can select any element in page , also JavaScript can program role and raect when a botton presssed for example
