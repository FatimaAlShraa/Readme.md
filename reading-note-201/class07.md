**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**

is a  set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world 
The state of an object is stored in fields (variables),while methods (functions) display the object's behavior.
In Java, an object is created using the keyword "new"
so how we can write object in literal notation :

var hotel = {

propareties and method 

};



and in dot notation:
 
let hotelName = object.properties/method

## constractore Function
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects so the constructor is called 
when an object of a class is created

this.name=name

this.age=age

}

Main.name( );
