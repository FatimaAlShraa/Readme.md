# List 
we use list in html to arrangement the information , so we will talk about 3 type of list:

+ **Order list** to list it by number for example 

< ol>
   < li>
      ahmad 
        < /li>
   < /ol>

+ **Unorder list**  

   < ul> 
     < li>
         asmar
       < /li>
      < / ul>

+ Definition List


## boxes

we can creat boxes in CSS and we can control width, height and border of the box
also we can limit it size in min or max , and we can change color as like text

div.box {

height: 300px;
width: 300px;
background-color;
}  

I understand about overflow that tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger 
than the box itself by hiddin and scroll

p.one {
overflow: hidden;}
p.two {
overflow: scroll;}

so to style boxs we have many CSS element for border,margin and padding ,also we can add image
shaddow or hiddin all of box .


## ARRAY

is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values
and the type of value in array is number

for example :

var colors = [ 'white' ----- > this is how can we creat array
'black' , 
'custom' ];



### SWITCH STATEMEN

The defferent between if statement and swich statement that in swich statement we can use 
actual value and share more than one value.

switch ( variable ) { 

                      case ' value 1 '
                         
                           do code 
                            break 

                        case ' value 2 '
                          do code 
                            break 
                       default : do if nothing match to the case


### Loop

*loop check a condetion if the condition is true a code will run until the condition retuns fulse
if condition fulse there are three common type of loop*

***For*** it's to run code in specifc number of time 

***While*** if we dont know how many times code will be true until the code is fulse it's break down

***Do While***  it's similar to wile loop but it's always run inside {} even the condition is fulse


in FOR loop use counter as condition we can use 3 statements :

* initialzation its only creat firs loop 

+ condition loop continue until specified number 

+ update ++ every time loop add one to counter in {}


***For(var i=0; i<5; i++)***
