# layout

we can design layout bage by using CSS element so we can use defferent element to posion 
normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floatsand I read a bout ixed width and liquid layouts, 
and how we can  created.

Position used four an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky)Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value..
so :

+ position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

+ position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

+ position: fixed; is positioned relative  it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled

+ position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned


for examples :

h1 {
position: fixed;

}

h1 {
position: absolute;
}

+ float: right; to move element left or right.

*when user open my webpage they have defferent screen size so they use defferent resolution in thier device*
