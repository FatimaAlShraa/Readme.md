# basic JavaScript instructions

I read befor about script which is s a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one
and the one instruction we call it statement  for example 

**var done="true"**

The example before the var it is shortcut for variable which is somthing to store value in JavaScript
so there is 3 of datatype store it in variable :

+ String ' any thing between quatation'

+ Number 2 , 2.5 , 1000

+ boolean true or fulse 


Then I read about operator which is symbole that dose an action and we have 4 type of
operator : * assignment operator  * artimetic operator   * comparison operator  * logic operator


about comparison op. the result will be T or F

== equal to value only 

=== equal to value and data type

!= is not equal value only 

!== is not equal value and data type



**logic op.** return sing value of true or fulse 


**&**  and (sympol of logical op.) if one retuns fulse the expression fulse 

**| |** or  if one retuns true the expression true 

**!** not  one retun true it's Fulse 

***if( condetion) { 
    
    the code   
               ---- > this is what called if 
                    statement or condetional statement  }***
 


else { code }    ---------- >  if else statement
