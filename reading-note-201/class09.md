 printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information so inHTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to
 different ements that allow you to collect information from visitors to 
your site.

Form structure consist of form , action , method :

or style of a bullet point for example :

p { 
list-style-type: lower-roman;}

and we can put image lke bullet point by using list-style-image

In table we can add some propareties like empty cell to hidden cell , also we can pu gap between cell

so THREE WAYS to bind an event to an ELEMENT:

+ HTML EVENT HANDLERS

+ TRADITIONAL DOM EVENT HANDLERS ---> element.even=code

+ DOM LEVEL 2 EVENT LISTENERS ---> element ('event',functionName [ boolran ] );
