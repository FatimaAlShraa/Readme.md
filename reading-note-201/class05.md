might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart

## color In CSS

by using CSS we can add color to text for example and controle shade of this color.

< p> 
color: gray;
< / p>

*background*
background-color property sets the color of the background

< h 1>
background-color:red;
< / h1>

so there are three type of color : 

+ rgb ( red green blue)

+ hex ( 6 grade ) 

+ color name 

+ HSL Colors ( hue , saturation , lightness)

## text

their something we call it a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually 
only display it if it's installed on that user's computer so we have wider choice of 
Typefaces we  can choose from are limited by their respective licenses
 
body {
 font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;}

body {
font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
font-size: 12px;}

to bold text : 

header {
font-weight: bold;}

we use UpperCase & LowerCase --- > This causes the text to appear lower or upper case

h1 {
text-transform: uppercase;}
