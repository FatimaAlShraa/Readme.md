# CSS
 
casecading style sheet it's language used to styling the page in browser its can style for example text, box and tables...etc
and CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern 
how the content of specified elements should be displayed

+ example how can we write css :

{ <h1 style="color:red" / > }




+ we can include CSS in HTML by link ( href, type and rel) or we can add < style>


## COLOR 

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element in 3 way:

+ rgb values ( red, green and blue)

+ hex codes (six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue)

+ color names

( color:red)

(backgrond-color:white)


- I can understand that the computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels and The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of 
a mix of red, green, and blue.

- also i knew about HUE (color) , Saturation (amount of gry in color) and Brightness(how much black in color)

### Contrast

contrast it's between foreground and background colors and we will make sure that there is 
enough contrast for the text to be legible.

THere is 3 level of contrast :

+ Low Contrast (Text is harder to read when there is low contrast)

+ High Contrast (Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast)

+ Medium Contrast (reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability)


### Opacity

in CSS3 we can specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements and the value nnumber between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).



+ ***hsla*** color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness 

+ ***Alpha***  expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency
